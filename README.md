# MeteorWisp

Project aiming to add [wisp](https://github.com/Gozala/wisp) support for meteor.

# Status
The project isn't published on Atmosphere yet, I havent found a way 
to load wisp core libraries for code that runs in the client.

Any pull requests allowing to do that would be much appreciated since it's 
the only part preventing me for publishing the package.

Right now, if you want a lisp with Meteor, you can use [lispyscript](http://lispyscript.com) with the [meteor-lispy](https://github.com/JeremS/meteor-lispy) package.
